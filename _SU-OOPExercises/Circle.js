// Write a class that represents a Circle. It has only one data property - itâ€™s radius, and it is set trough the constructor. 
// The class needs to have getter and setter methods for its diameter - the setter needs to calculate the radius and change it 
// and the getter needs to use the radius to calculate the diameter and return it.
// The circle also has a getter area(), which calculates and returns its area.

// Output
// The diameter() and area() getters should return numbers.
// Submit the class definition as is, without wrapping it in any function.

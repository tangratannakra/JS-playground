// Your task here is to deliver a class that can be extended.Implement an extend(template)
// method that would copy all of the properties of template to the instance(not to all instances,
//     just the one from which the method was called) and
// if the property is a
// function, add it to the objectâ€™ s prototype instead.

// In addition, the base class needs to have an ID property that is unique and autoincremented sequentally
// for every new instance.

// Input / Output
// The extend()
// function of your class will receive a valid object as input parameter, and has no output.
// Structure your code as an IIFE that returns the class.

// let obj1 = new Extensible();
// let obj2 = new Extensible();
// let obj3 = new Extensible();
// console.log(obj1.id); //0
// console.log(obj2.id); //1
// console.log(obj3.id); //2
